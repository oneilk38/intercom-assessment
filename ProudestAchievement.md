### Kevin O'Neill 
My proudest achievement would be the work I put in to get hired by Walmart, and then that ultimately paying off in me getting a promotion after just 10 months of working here. 

I should preface this by saying prior to joining Walmart, I was not where I wanted to be in terms of my skillset and knowledge after college. I pushed myself to look for a role that would challenge me and teach me things the way I wanted. After getting through Walmarts tough interview process, I hit the ground running and really enjoyed every second of it. 
I was surrounded by senior engineers who loved to teach me things and were as eager to answer my questions as I was to ask. 

I am immensely proud of the work I put in since joining, and my effort to self-improve and continuously learn - I credit my promotion to my ability to learn quickly , ask questions and work extremely hard. 

I was very proud when I got the promotion, and even prouder when I found out I had been named a Top Performer on my team for 2020. 

Thanks for taking time to review my assessment, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
